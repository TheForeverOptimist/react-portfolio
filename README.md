# Sean Munjal's Portfolio


Hi I'm Sean 👋

I'm an AI/ML enthusiast with a focus on Generative AI applications. I'm currently a full stack developer at a Health & Fitness Tech Startup that utilizes computer vision to help minimize the typing and tapping on a phone screen for logging gym workouts and diet.

My portfolio was built with simplicity in mind. 

Frameworks, Libraries & Language of this Portfolio:

## 🤟 JavaScript (Language)
## 📈 React (Application Framework)
## 🏗️ Material UI (UI Components)
## 🚀 GSAP (Animations)

Though this portfolio had simplicity in mind, you will find that many of the projects in my portfolio are well-excuted full stack applications many of which use generative AI princples to provide real world solutions.

Hope to speak with you soon.
